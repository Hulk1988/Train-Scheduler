A fornt-end app that lets users determine how mamy minutes the next train is in respect to the current time.

Utilizes Fire Base, APIs, HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, and Jquery.

Using this app the user will be able to determine when the next train will arrive in minutes.

The user is expected to provide the following:

A challenge that I faced with this project was working with and understanding `moment.JS`, and getting the data to append to the desired location on the screen. I overcame this by reading Moment DOCS and reviewing examples of it's usage and applications. I was able to successfully utilize moment.JS after I spent some time working with it. By utilizing the correct syntax, I was able to get the data to append correctly.
